    - Fluffy Totoro
    - This fluffy Totoro from the movie "My Neighbor Totoro" is the only plush you'll

      aura of calmness only challenged by Buddhists who have reached nirvana. If you
      are looking for a plush to quench your thirst for fluffiness look no further!

    - It's so fluffy unicorn
    - The most fluffy unicorn you have held in you hands in your entire life. It's
      fluffyness makes all your problems melt away and rainbows appear right in front
      of you. It is said one squish of this unicorn can cure cancer! It makes even
      the hardest rock soft to the touch. It is better than cocaine, heroin and sugar
      mixed together and will make you feel more alive than you have ever felt.
